# JIM'S BOWL-O-RAMA

A bowling scorecard app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview

This is a bowling scorecard app that keeps track of your score with each turn and frame. This was built using an iterative process: a minimum viable product (see the 'mvp' branch), styling improvements (see the 'style' branch), and finally a confetti package (see 'confetti' branch). Each branch was push to 'testing' before a pull request to 'main'.

Easter egg: Bowl a 300 for a party surprise!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install'

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
